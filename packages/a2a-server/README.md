# Gemini CLI A2A Server

## All code in this package is experimental and under active development

This package contains the A2A server implementation for the Gemini CLI.

## Configuration

- Set the `CODER_AGENT_INTERACTIVE` environment variable to `true` (values
  `true`, `1`, `yes`, or `on`) before launching the server to place the
  underlying Gemini config into interactive mode. Leave it unset or any other
  value to keep the default non-interactive behavior.
